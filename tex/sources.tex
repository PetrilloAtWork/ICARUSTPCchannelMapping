\section{Sources}
\label{sec:sources}

The mapping can be deduced based on the following information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item geometric information from ICARUS detector blueprints~\cite{SBNDocDB1020}
    (with the caveat that second induction and collection planes on one of the
    TPCs are swapped, see \cref{fig:WirePlanesInTPC})
  \item undocumented information on the cabling, reported in \cref{ssec:CablingInfo}
  \item information from the (currently unpublished) general technical note
    on the TPC connectivity test~\cite{SBNDocDBxxxx:ConnTest},
    replicated in \cref{ssec:PlaneAssignment}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Cabling details}
\label{ssec:CablingInfo}

This information was provided by Angela Fava:
\begin{itemize}
  \item all cables are installed sequentially at the TPC end, and the wires within the flat cable are numbered following the same sequence;
  \item for Induction1 A1-33, B1-33, C1-33 and D-133 are all top to bottom (therefore the red conductor is at the top);
  \item for corners F1-17 and H1-17 are bottom to top, while E1-17 and K1-17 are top to bottom;
  \item please note that there is a mistake in Fig. 2 at page 7 in the tech note, in that the South-East corner is Collection and the North-East is Induction 2;
  \item for standard chimneys 1 to 9 and 10 to 18 SHOULD be North to South, but for cross-checking this I have asked photo documentation to Andrea Zani and Claudio and I am waiting on their reply.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Assignment of wire planes to minicrate sides}
\label{ssec:PlaneAssignment}
The assignment of wire planes to minicrate sides is somehow problematic. According to the cabling schemes in the  CERN EDMS documents \cite{EDMS1531207v1}, provided by A.~Fava and A.~Zani, this assignment is the same for all TPCs:
\begin{itemize}
     \item flat cables from 1 to 9 are connected to wires on the \emph{collection plane}
      \item flat cables from 10 to 18 are connected to wires on the \emph{second induction plane}
\end{itemize}
On the other hand, the connectivity tests measurements described in \cite{SBNDocDBxxxx:ConnTest} and \cite{SBNDocDB14316} suggest that this assignment depends on the TPC:
\begin{itemize}
 \item In chimneys on West TPCs (\TPC{WW} and \TPC{EW}):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item flat cables from 1 to 9 are connected to wires on the \emph{collection plane}
       \item flat cables from 10 to 18 are connected to wires on the \emph{second induction plane}
  \end{itemize}
\item In chimneys on East TPCs (\TPC{WE} and \TPC{EE}):
  \begin{itemize}
      \item flat cables from 1 to 9 are connected to wires on the \emph{second induction plane}
       \item flat cables from 10 to 18 are connected to wires on the \emph{collection plane}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
This ambiguity is being investigated; it is likely to be fully solved only by looking at real data.
