\begin{description}
  \item[collection plane] is the wire plane farthest from the cathode,
    with most of the wires read on top of the anode frame and a few read on one
    of the anode frame sides
  \item[first induction plane] is the wire plane closest to the cathode,
    with 9-meter long wires being read out on the sides of the anode frame
  \item[flange] one of the 96 interfaces between cold and warm volumes
    \emph{serving the TPC wire planes}
    (other flanges, \eg the ones serving the photomultipliers, are never
    considered in this document)
  \item[flat cable] each of the 68-wire twisted-pair cables connecting one side
    of the decoupling and biasing board to a group of 32 contiguous TPC wires
    at the anode frame
  \item[minicrate] metal crate hosting nine readout boards,
    and installed on the warm side of each of the 96 flanges.
  \item[second induction plane] is the middle wire plane,
    with most of the wires read on top of the anode frame and a few read on one
    of the anode frame sides
